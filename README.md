# Installation

There may be no other necessary libraries to run code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. However, note that python 3.0 or above will be needed to run the code.

# Project Motivation

This project is in the completion of the Udacity Data Science Nano Degree lesson 1 project. Airbnb Data of Boston and Seattle listings downloaded from Kaggle.com. The project tries to answer four questions. 
1.	What is the best property type and number of bedrooms to start an Airbnb business in Seattle or Boston market areas?
2.	What is the best cancellation policy to adopt for listings? 
3.	What are the basic Amenities needed, before listing the property?
4.	Predicting the price of listings?

# File Descriptions

There are two files in the project_1 folder, consisting of;
1.	A .ipynb file (notebook) with a defined sequence of data load, processing, explanatory and exploratory processes in trying to answer the above-listed questions. Markdown cells with comments used to assist in walkthrough the entire code run steps. The questions posed, and conclusions stated afterward. 
2.	A .py file containing python scripts (functions) used in the data preparation process. 

# Results

Though questions posed are/may be answered on the code, more explanation can found on this post available <link>
